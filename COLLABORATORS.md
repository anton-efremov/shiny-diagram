# Shiny Contributor & Developer Guide

> **Implementation state:** Current  
> **Document state:** Maintained
> **Last reviewed:** 2026-06-19  
> **Scope:** High-level map of repository without technical implementation details

This document is the primary engineering entry point for human developers and the operational traffic controller for the AI agent team. Documents marked **Document state: Maintained** are authoritative. When code conflicts with a maintained document, report the deviation instead of copying it into documentation as the intended design.

## Document metadata

Each document in `docs/` and current document carries metadata fields at the top. State of the document is described by two of them:

- **Implementation state** describes how closely the code reflects the document.
	- `aspirational` — the document describes the intended design; the code has not yet caught up
	- `current` — the code is supposed to match what the document describes

- **Document state** describes the editorial status of the document itself.
	- `maintained` — kept up to date as decisions evolve; treat as reliable
	- `work-in-progress` — actively being revised; content may be incomplete or unstable
	- `stale` — known to lag behind current decisions; read with caution for the context

A document can be `aspirational` and `maintained` at the same time — the target is stable and trusted, but the code hasn't reached it yet. Implementation state and document state are independent.

If `current` and `maintained` is not in line with codebase, it means a bug either in code base or in docs - **report it immediately**
