# Mermaid Vocabulary (class diagrams)

> **Implementation state:** Current  
> **Document state:** Maintained
> **Last reviewed:** 2026-07-14  
> **Scope:** The closed vocabulary for provenance and write-back, rooted in the structure of the Mermaid class-diagram language and the Shiny annotation dialect it carries in comments. Documents and annotations that speak about source use these terms; no improvised names.

## 1. Ontology

### 1.1 Token categories

A token's category is its function in place; the same glyph may serve different categories in different positions.

| Category | Function | Inventory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| keyword | names the kind of the statement it opens | Mermaid: `classDiagram` `class` `namespace` `note` `classDef` `style` <br> Shiny dialect: `@spatial:` `@style:` `@note:` |
| identifier | denotes a diagram element | any name the author writes: class names, namespace paths, style definition names |
| selective operator | relates or modifies the components adjacent to it; chosen from a closed set of alternatives | relationship: `<\|--` `*--` `o--` `-->` `--` `..>` `..\|>` `..` (arrowheads may appear on both ends) <br> classifier: `*` `$` |
| fixed operator | relates or modifies the components adjacent to it; the only legal token at its position | application: `:::` <br> attachment: `:` `for` <br> assignment: `=` |
| literal | carries verbatim text or numbers; no language function | any text or number the author writes: `User account`, `1..*`, `#f00`, `interface` |
| property name | names the property an entry assigns | style properties `fill` `color` ..., coordinates `x` `y` `w` `h` |
| delimiter | bounds or separates structure; nothing more | `{ }` `[ ]` `~ ~` `<< >>` `" "` `,` `%%` |

**value** = identifier ∪ literal ∪ selective operator — the tokens that the author chooses.

### 1.2 Syntactic categories

| Category  | Meaning                                                                                        | Examples                                 |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| clause    | a literal enclosed in a delimiter pair, forming one component with one meaning. Often optional | `~T~`, `["User account"]`, `"1..*"`      |
| entry     | a property name and a literal, joined by a assignement operator `:`/`=`                        | `fill:#f00`, `x=0`                       |
| list      | a `,`-separated sequence of any number of entries                                              | `fill:#f00,color:#fff`                   |
| block     | a body of statements                                                                           | class body, namespace body, diagram body |
| statement | a self-contained unit of code within its scope; simple, or opening a block                     | `class User`, `namespace Domain { ... }` |

### 1.3 Identity

- A **class identifier** is a bare name, diagram-global. Which body its declaration sits in is a containment fact, not part of the identifier.
- A **namespace identifier** is a dotted path: `Domain.Sub`. Renaming or moving a namespace renames every descendant path — and every reference spelling those paths.
- Members, relationships, notes, and style applications bind no identifier; they are identified by content and position.

## 2. Statements

| note statement                       | `note for User "text"`               | diagram body                 |
| note annotation statement            | `%% @note: x=0 y=0 w=10 h=10`        | diagram body                 |

### 2.2 Language rules

- The diagram statement is the only statement written at file root; its body is the diagram body.
- A reference to an unbound class identifier **implicitly binds** it — a class first seen in a relationship statement exists without a declaration statement.
- A member is written in exactly one form — block or short — never both.
- A note annotation statement binds to the note statement on the immediately following line; the pair is written, moved, and deleted together.
- `%% @...` statements are the Shiny annotation dialect: valid Mermaid comments carrying Shiny data.

## 3. Statement composition

## 4. Shiny model

How the ontology surfaces in Shiny's pipeline; details in [Write-Back Pipeline](./write-back-pipeline.md).

### 4.1 Provenance

Provenance is the syntactic index built at parse: for every statement it records where the statement and its components are written.

- One record per **statement**, keyed by the element it declares: the statement's own span, and spans for its components (identifiers, clause literals, entries, body).
- An element without a record is **implicitly bound** (1.3) — it exists in the diagram but owns no statement, so it cannot be edited or anchored to in place.
- Member records are kept separately by written form — block or short.

### 4.2 Write-back

A single write addresses exactly one unit; the unit dictates the legal operations:

- **statement** — insertion, deletion. 
  List of statements in 2.1, first column "Statement"
- **entry** — insertion, deletion.

| Statement        | Entries              |
| ---------------- | -------------------- |
| style definition | style property entry |
| direct style     | style property entry |
- **clause** — insertion, deletion.

| Statement | Clauses |
| --- | --- |
| class declaration | class generic, class label |
| relationship | relationship label, source multiplicity, target multiplicity |
- **value** — replace.

| Statement | Values |
| --- | --- |
| class declaration | class name, class generic, class label |
| block / short member | member text, member owner |
| relationship | endpoint, multiplicity, relationship operator, relationship label |
| style definition | style definition name, style property value |
| direct style | direct style target, style property value |
| style application | style application target, style application name |
| namespace declaration | namespace name |
| spatial annotation | spatial target, spatial coordinate |
| namespace style annotation | namespace style target, namespace style properties (the whole list, one span) |
| note annotation | spatial coordinate |
| note | note text |

**Rules:**

- Keywords, fixed operators, property names, and delimiters are never write targets; they change only as part of a statement or entry written whole.
- An optional component is inserted or deleted as a clause; components that are not clauses change only via whole-statement rewrite.
- Coordinate entries are never inserted or deleted — the fixed set of four admits only replacing their literals.
- There is no whole-statement replace: a statement changes shape only by delete + insert.
